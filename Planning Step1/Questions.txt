Questions to be answered by the Stakeholder

How many players will the tournament handle? Is it varible?
If a tournament has less than the full complement of players, how do we handle it? (4 player works; but what about 3 at the start?)
Should the ordering of who plays eac other be random or ordered by input order?
Should we schedulr the game or are they just played whenever?
If the games are scheduled, how does the system know when to schedule games for? 
If the games are played whenever, can a game from the second round be played before the first round is complete?
Does the system need to store a score of some kind or just who won?
What type of front-end should this system have (form , webpage, app, etc.)?
Where will the data be stored? (Maybe on SQL?)
Will the system handle entry fees, prizes, or other payouts?
What type of reporting is needed? // need a score-card? How to present the results?
Who can fill in the results of a game? // is the computer going to do this or by a admin person?
Are there varying levels of access? // some people can have limited access but the admin can have full rights? 
Should this system contact users about upcoming games? // Email ?
Is each player on their own or can teams use this tournament tracker?
